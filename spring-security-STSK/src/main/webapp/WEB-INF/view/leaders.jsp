<p>
	See you in Brazil ... for our annual Leadership retreat!
	<br>
	If your actions inspire others to dream more, 
     learn more, do more and become more, you are a leader.
     Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower.
     Do not follow where the path may lead. 
     Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail
	<br>
	Keep this trip a secret, don't tell the regular employees LOL :-)
